\chapter{Future work}\label{ch:future_work}

The Hummingbird framework and MOGL, although functional, are far from being complete. 
The following list is a sample of what could be done to improve and extend the project.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Data locality}: Proper object pools for Actors and Behaviors to take advantage of caching
and avoid the iteration over inactive Actors and Behaviors.
\item \textbf{Hide the glm dependencie from the user}: Use only glm classes internaly, to the point that 
the eventual user of the MOGL plugin doesn't need to know it is used inside (as in not having to include its headers).
\item \textbf{3D rendering}: implement more Drawable Behaviors for rendering arbitrary 3D geometry.
\end{itemize}

There is a lot that can be done, in the end this is just the core of what a game 
engine is and inside every part of a game engine lots of tweaking can be done.
