\subsection{Time and Clock}

The Time class represents a time interval. It has nanoseconds precision and can 
queried for its value in seconds, milliseconds, microseconds and nanoseconds.

The Clock class mesures time intervals and stores them in an instance of Time. 
Clock too has nanoseconds precision.

Usage example:
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Clock and Time example]
hum::Clock clk;
while(game\_is\_running)
{
  hum::Time deltaTime = clk.reset();
  ... // Game code
}
\end{lstlisting}
