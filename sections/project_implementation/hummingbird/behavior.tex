\subsection{Behavior}

Class from which inherit to implement and give an Actor behavior.

A Behavior always lives inside an Actor. Said actor takes care of the lifecycle
of the Behavior.

For creating a custom Behavior you may inherit from this class and override
the methods you need to implement the wanted functionality.

Behaviors must also implement a \texttt{static const char* behaviorName()} method that,
as the name hints, returns the class name. This is used for error reporting.

Usage example:
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Behavior example.]
class PrintTransform : public hum::Behavior
{
public:
    void init() override
    {
        hum::log("Behavior initialized");
    }

    void fixedUpdate() override
    {
        hum::log("Actor transformation: ", actor().transform());
    }

    void onDestroy() override
    {
        hum::log("Actor destroyed");
    }

    static const char* behaviorName()
    {
        return "PrintTransform";
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}
