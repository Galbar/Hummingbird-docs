\subsection{Camera}

The Camera is the device through which the player views the world.

By default the camera is set to be orthogonal. It is placed at the point (0, 0, -1)
and looks towards (0, 0, 1) with a viewport of 100 by 100. The (0, 0) is located at
the top left corner with the x-axis growing to the right and the y-axis growing
downwards.

Said default configuration is equivalent to the following code fragment:
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Camera default settings]
mogl::Camera cam;
cam.setZNear(0.1f);
cam.setZFar(1000.f);
cam.setOrthogonal(0, -100, 100, 0);
cam.setPosition(hum::Vector3f(0, 0, -1));
cam.setCenter(hum::Vector3f(0, 0, 1));
cam.setUp(hum::Vector3f(0, -1, 0));
\end{lstlisting}
