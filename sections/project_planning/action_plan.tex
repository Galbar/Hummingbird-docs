\section{Action plan}

The idea is to follow the plan as described above, completing tasks in the specified 
order and inside their planned time span.
The plan described in the Gantt chart consists of a schedule of 4 hours a day and 
does not include weekends. If at some point there is some kind of obstacle that may 
slow the development of one of the tasks it is possible to work on weekends to get 
up-to-date with the planning.

Each task that consists of development also includes the documentation of said piece 
of code using Doxygen. This way, when the implementation is done I'll immediately 
have its documentation without having to go back into the code.

Every time a major task is completed a meeting with the project director is to be 
scheduled to review the progress.

In the case of an unexpected extraordinary delay, the project planning will be adjusted 
accordingly by taking advantage of the time available between the planned ending of 
the project and the presentation date.
