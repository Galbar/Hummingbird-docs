\chapter{Scope}\label{ch:scope}

This project is part of a bigger project that consists of developing a full game engine. 
Due to time constraints the project will be limited to just the core of the game engine. 
Said core will consist of the framework that results of this project and that will 
be limited to the functionalities listed in the objectives above. For the sake of 
simplicity and avoiding possible complications, the framework spatial system will 
be limited to the 2 dimensional plane.

Moreover, the project does not consist of developing a game nor it is part of it. 
It's sole goal is to develop the game framework.
