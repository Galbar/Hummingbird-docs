\chapter{Objective}\label{ch:objective}

The goal of this project is to design and implement a game development framework that 
solves the problem described in the previous section. The framework will have solved 
the problem when it presents the functionalities listed bellow.

\begin{itemize}
\item The framework implements some basic helper classes for game development. That is, 
a way to describe transformations of objects and tools for measuring and storing intervals 
of time;
\item The framework implements a main loop with fixed update;
\item The framework handles the creation, destruction and storage of game actors. These 
actors will contain behaviors that will define its actions and properties;
\item The framework offers a way of handling resources (loading, accessing, freeing);
\item The framework will allow extending the main loop with a plug-in system. This feature 
makes possible adding a rendering pipeline, physics simulation, etc. without having 
to touch the framework code.
\end{itemize}

Finally, for demonstrating the usage of the plug-in system. This project will also 
implement a plug-in that wraps the SFML library. The SFML plug-in will implement:

\begin{itemize}
\item The resource management of textures, music, sounds, etc. using the structure offered 
by the framework;
\item An input handling system;
\item A 2D rendering pipeline using the SFML utilities.
\end{itemize}
