\chapter{Formulation of the problem}\label{ch:formulation_of_the_problem}

The problem I want to solve is having to implement the same infrastructure every 
time that I make a game. That infrastructure consists of having a main loop, a pool 
of game objects (each of them possibly having different behaviors) and handling their 
data.

This infrastructure, framework, must also be flexible enough to allow me to experiment 
with new technologies (rendering libraries, networking, physics, etc.) in the future 
without requiring to change its code, making it widely easier to develop games.
