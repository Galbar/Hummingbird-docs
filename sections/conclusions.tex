\chapter{Conclusions}\label{ch:conclusions}

It has been a lot of work but I have learned more about the problems of implementing, 
not a game, but the scaffolding on top of which games are made.

Some features I've had to leave outside of the project due to time constraints and 
those were tough decisions I had to make in order to have a stable and functional product by 
the end.

Throughout the development, I managed to get feedback from some colleagues and my project's 
director, Guillem Godoy, and I've taken their views in the implementation so that 
the framework was as simple to use as possible.

In the end, I am satisfied with the current status of the project. The objectives were 
accomplished and exceeded and I feel the architecture makes it easier for developers 
to make games and learn by extending the framework using any preferred technology;
or just make a game using the MOGL plugin and focus on the game design and mechanics.
