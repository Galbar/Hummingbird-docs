\section{Enemy Spawner}

EnemySpawner, as its name suggests spawns enemies. It spawns a new one every half second 
and positions it randomly inside the viewport.

We will implement the EnemySpawner using a Plugin. This way we don't need to have an extra 
actor in the game (good for Bullet's checks).

The implementation of the spawner is quite simple. In the constructor we store a pointer to 
the player, so that we can pass it to the Enemies it creates. Then in the \textit{preUpdate}, 
if the player is dead does nothing, otherwise it creates a new Enemy every half second.

        if (p_player->isDead())
        {
            return;
        }
        if (clk.getTime().asSeconds() > 0.5)
        {
            auto enemy = game().makeActor();
            enemy->addBehavior<Enemy>(p_player);

            enemy->transform().position.x = rand() % (1000/48);
            enemy->transform().position.y = rand() % (1000/48);
            clk.reset();
        }
    }
